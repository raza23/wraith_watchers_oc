## Overview
We are building a fun Next.JS application that displays ghost sightings across the United States. The name of the application is WraitherWatchers. This is just for fun
using synthetic data that is provided and displays them on a map and table. The user can also add new sightings


## Initial Instuctions
- I want you to play the roll of an expert full-stack developer
- I will be providing you the initial prompt filled with a lot of informtion for the application.
- Your first task is to review the instructions and confirm you understand the context. 
- Do NOT write any code yet.
- I will supply you with the first step. 

## Functionality
-Refer to the mockups I am supplying.
-The basic functionality of the application is composed of 1 page, and 2 popups
Page 1- Sighting Map and Table
--This page includes a few stats on sightings. It includes the total number of sightings. It includes the most recent sightings. It includes the most recent sightings. Refer to homepage.png. 
--This page also includes a map with markers specifying the area of the sightings. When you click on the marker, a pop-up will appear that shows more information about the sighting. It also includes an image of the sighting if one exists. 
--This page also includes a table of all the sightings available
--This page includes a filter system that allows you to look for sightings that have a particular set of characteristics. 
--On the map you can also have the option to submit a sighting based on where you are on the map by clicking the a button 'Add sighting' on the top right corner of the map. Refer to addSightingForm.png 
--When clicking the button a form will appear in which you can add the sighting and aftwerwards a banner will appear on the form state 'Succesfully Submitted'


## Visual Identity 
Use the below contents in <visual identy> as a reference for the visual identity of the application

<visual identiy>
Core Aesthetic: Minimalist, playful-yet-mysterious, blending modern flat design with retro-inspired halftones and bold contrast.
Color Scheme:
Primary: Deep black (#000000) for backgrounds.
Secondary: Soft ivory/ghost white (#F8F8F8) for main ghost figures.
Accent: Subtle warm hues like faded orange (#FF9F40) or muted gray tones (#6E6E6E) for depth.
Optional: Gradient halftone textures to suggest “fading into the unseen.”
Visual Style:
Flat and clean vector shapes with rounded edges.
Occasional halftone or stippled shading for texture.
Simple silhouettes with large eye cutouts for personality.
Minimal detail—shapes do the storytelling.
Play with symmetry/asymmetry for quirky character.
Tone:
Mysterious but not scary.
Quirky and approachable, with a hint of dark whimsy.
Balances between “serious map tool” and “fun folklore project.”
Typography:
Sans-serif, slightly condensed, geometric (e.g., Inter, Space Grotesk).
High contrast against dark backgrounds.
Iconography & Imagery:
Ghosts as rounded, flowing, slightly drippy or floating shapes.
Occasional playful illustrations (ghost sipping coffee, peeking, drifting).
Logos or marks that merge letters and ghost silhouettes (e.g., "G" integrated into a ghost).
Layout & Feel:
Dark backgrounds with floating white/ivory ghost elements.
Sparse use of accent color for buttons, map markers, or hover states.
Clean grid, lots of negative space.
Subtle animations: fade-ins, drifts, slight wiggles (evoking ghostly movement).

## Coding Style
-- Use Next.js and tailwind
-- Use Leaflet for the map. Consider if you need to find a React speicift implementation of leaflet for this to work. 


## Data 
-- Use the datafile that i Have provided in context in data/sample.csv
-- This provides you with the schema for the datafields we will be providing.
